# tcharron-dotfiles

This repo is designed to boostrap my full development environment from scratch.
In December 2024, I purged the Git history because it contained too much
workplace-specific configurations and made the Git history sloppy and confusing.

This makes the Git history appear as though this repo was only created recently,
when in reality the dotfiles have been evolving for many years.

## Installation

cd $HOME

git clone git@github.com:charron-tom/dotfiles.git
